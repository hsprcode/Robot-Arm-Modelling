# Robot-Arm-Modelling-From-Scratch

## Dynamic equations of motion for the robot arm
The dynamic_equations_of_motion.m code gives the equations in symbolic varible which gets substituted using the default DH parameters defined (can be changed).

## ODE solver 
Solving the equations of motion (Ordinary differential equations) of the arm.

## Transformation Matrix
Using user defined joints, the code homogeneous_transform_hspr.m symbolically gives the transformation matrix.
